# Bearacade Racing Game

After installing node modules in both the `client/` and `server/` directories, 
just run `docker-compose up -d` in the main directory and everything should start.

Both the client and the server will auto-restart when code is changed, so simply wait for 
the builds to finish and refresh your browser. You can see the status of the builds in the
docker logs.
